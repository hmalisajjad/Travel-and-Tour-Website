# Travel-and-Tour-Website

Our aim is to design and create a data management system for U & A Travels. This enables customer to rent a vehicle and hire a guider or rent a hotel room that can be used temporarily during a specified period of time. This system increase customer relations and simplify reservations and staff management.
The website U & A Travels has a very user-friendly interface so that the users will easily make different reservations. By using this system client can manage their rental, hotels, and tour guide and vehicle issues.
The new data can be added or an existed data can be edited or deleted by the administrators.
The customer should visit our website and avail different type of facilities that are available there. Then he/she can view the available cars in a branch and make a reservation for a car or holidays planning.
So this system provides benefit to both the owner and the customer in different ways.

In this project I had made a responsive website for a travel agency which is basically providing facility of rent a vehicle of different types and also provide the facility of trip management like they manage different tours. 
Customer can avail different type of facilities from this website like customer can online book their vehicle and customer can online schedule their trip and avail different facilities provided by company. 
This company also provides tour operators and hotels reservations for their customers.
